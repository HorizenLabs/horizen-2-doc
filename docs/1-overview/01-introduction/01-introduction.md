# What is Horizen

Horizen is the next generation EVM chain specifically tailored to building zero-knowledge (ZK) dApps.

Designed to be closely connected to the <a href="http://docs.zkverify.io">zkVerify chain</a>, and to be the natural evolution of both the previous Horizen's chains, ZEND Mainchain and EON: ZEN is the native currency of Horizen, and your existing ZEN holdings and EON applications will migrate smoothly.
