# Precompiles

A precompiled contract is native Substrate code that has an Ethereum-style address and can be called using the Ethereum API, like any other smart contract. <br/>
From a client perspective, they can be seen as standard pre-deployed smart contracts.<br/>
This section will summarize the precompiles available in Horizen and the methods they expose.
